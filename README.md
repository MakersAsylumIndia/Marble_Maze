DiY hour Marble Maze

- the design is parametric in FreeCAD. Set the number of cells required in X and Y direction, and save the DXF's for laser cutting.
- The /DXF folder contains 3x2 (for trial) and 10x8 size maze.
- Number of barriers (clear acrylic) - You need a set for the Maze perimeter, so for 3x2 you need 10 ((3+2)*2) and for 10x8 you need 36. Plus you need additional barriers for the actual maze.
- You need two identical acrylic pieces for the "top" and "bottom". Top needs to be clear. Bottom can be opaque.
- You need one "foam" piece which sticks to the "bottom" acrylic.
- After sticking the foam to the bottom, remove the circular traps where needed, but preserve the discarded foam circles in casy you need to adjust the maze traps.
- Add the barriers to the top piece, and then assemble the whole.
